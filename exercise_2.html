		/*
		* Exercise Two
		* Why does the following output true?
		*/

		var a = "false";
		var b = true;

		// "&&" is "and"
		console.log (b && a);

		/* Answer: The AND operator (&&) returns true if both expressions are true, otherwise it returns false. Since "false" is a string then it qualifies as true (if it had been an empty string then it would be considered falsy) and since b is also true then the output equals true.*/
				/*

		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"?
		
		Answer: Short-circuiting, apersands (boolean) will return the first falsy value or the last value
		EXAMPLE: (1 && 2 && 0 && 4) would return 0 due to short circuiting
		EXAMPLE: (1 && "" && 0 && 4) would return 
		
		ADDITIONAL NOTES:
		If it's OR is works in the opposite direction: It returns the first truthy value or the last value
		EXAMPLE: (1 || "" || 0 || 4) would return 1

		EXAMPLE: var a = prompt("What?");
				 var b = a || "default";

		ANSWER: If nothing was inputted in the prompt then a would be considered falsy thus the only truthy in var b is the string "default".
